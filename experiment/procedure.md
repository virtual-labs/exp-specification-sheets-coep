 The steps required to prepare a specification sheet for an instrument. Before you start preparing the specification sheet you need to review once again
 P&I diagram and instrument index sheet. These documents are basis for the development of specification sheet and referring latest version will be mandatory. 
 Please see the document control box on the P&I sheet and check its version before starting the work. 
 
###### Step1 : 
Identify the purpose and intended use of the instrument. This will help you focus on the most relevant information to include in the datasheet. 
For this step you will have to refer to Process Description Document (PDD) and Process Flow Diagram (PFD).

###### Step2 :
Gather information about the technical specifications of the instrument. This might include the measurement range, accuracy, resolution, and precision
 of the instrument, as well as any other relevant technical details.
 
###### Step3 : 
Collect information about the performance characteristics of the instrument. This might include the response time, stability, and sensitivity
 of the instrument, as well as any other relevant performance data.
 
###### Step4 :
Determine the operating conditions of the instrument, such as the temperature, humidity, and pressure range in which it can be used.
 It is also essential to know the plant environment with extent dirt, dust, and any hazardous gases available in environment.
 
###### Step5 :  
Obtain physical dimensions and weight data for the instrument. This information will be required where you have installation constraint.

###### Step6 : 
Determine the electrical requirements of the instrument, such as the power input, voltage, and current. This information will be in tune
 with the power supplies used along with a control system as bulk power supply.
 
###### Step7 : 
Organize the information in a clear and concise manner, using tables and bullet points to make the information easy to read and understand.
 This is included as a standard specification sheet.
 
###### Step8 : 
Review the Specification sheet for accuracy and completeness, and make any necessary revisions. To take care of this aspect generally specification 
sheet will have three signatures viz. prepared by, checked by, and approved by. Ensure this document goes under all three entities.

It will be helpful to use a template or examples of other instrument Specification sheets as a guide when creating your own.
Overall, an instrument Specification sheet is an essential resource for anyone (Instrumentation Engineer serving with client, consultant or contractor)
who uses or works with a specific instrument or device. It provides important information that can help users make informed decisions and ensure 
the proper use and operation of the instrument.
